# A grammar-derived C YAML parser generator — implementation plan

Emit a fast, single-pass, pull-driven YAML 1.2 parser in C **from the formal productions** — so that correctness is a
property of the generator, not of hand-testing. The output is the machine you'd hand-write anyway; the value is that a
proof, not luck, says it's the right language.

- Target: **libyamlstar** ABI-compatible `.so`
- Complexity: **O(n)**, libyaml-class
- API: **pull** · `ys_read_token()`
- Stream: **yeast** · reference-identical codes

Throughout, the grammar's parameters split by two fates and it matters everywhere: **`c`** (context), **`t`** (chomping)
and **`r`** (the resume policy) are finite, so they are resolved at generation time (static); **`n`** (indentation) and
**`m`** (the auto-detected indent) are unbounded, so they are threaded into the runtime automaton.

## §0 — Why this, and why it's hard

Every YAML parser to date sits on one horn of a dilemma.

**YAMLStar** (pure Clojure) is mechanically faithful to the ~211 productions but slow — naive backtracking over the
grammar can go superlinear, and it ships a heavy runtime (GraalVM today, Go tomorrow). The **libyaml-class**
hand-written state machine is fast and O(n) but its conformance is established test-by-test; it has known deviations
from the 1.2 grammar and is "faithful by luck."

The reconciliation is a machine that is *both*: a deterministic, committed, character-at-a-time automaton with an
indentation stack and bounded deferred-token tracking — **generated from the parameterized productions** so that its
speed comes from the state machine and its fidelity comes from the derivation. That generator is the whole prize, and it
is a small compiler, not a weekend parser.

**The one load-bearing fact:** YAML restricts implicit ("simple") keys to a **single line**. That restriction is what
makes determinization finite, makes the deferred-token set bounded, and makes a pull `next_token()` able to return
without draining the whole document. It is doing triple duty and the entire architecture rests on it.

It bounds the *key* deferral, and nothing else. There is a second, and the block scalar is where it lives.

**Indentation detection is not the problem.** A block collection's indentation, and an inline one's, are read straight
off the current column — YamlReference peeks past comment lines first, but `s-l-comments` has already eaten them, so
there is nothing to peek past. Those two cost no lookahead at all.

**The empty lines that open a block scalar are the problem, and the chomping is why.** An empty line there is content if
a content line follows it — `l-empty`, a `line-feed` — and is chomped away if none does — `b-non-content`, a `break`.
The same line, told apart by something that has not happened yet. So none of those tokens can be handed back until the
parser reaches a content line or the end of the scalar, and the run of them has no bound: YAML bounds lookahead only for
implicit keys, at 1024 characters, and says nothing at all here.

Nor is this an artefact of yeast. The *value* depends on it too — `|-` with two blank lines and nothing after is `""`,
and with `text` after is `"\n\ntext"` — so any parser that produces a value looks exactly as far.

So libyeast queues them. The tokens of the run are built and held, none handed back; when the run resolves, either they
become content and the scalar's end arrives later, or `end-scalar` is **injected ahead of them** and they become the
breaks that were chomped away — the marker's position is what says they were never content. `end-block-scalar` exists to
emit that marker, and without it an empty stripped block scalar opens a scalar it never closes.

`max_bytes` bounds it, being the same guard a single enormous token needs. The buffered input, the tokens held back with
it, and the stack that deep nesting grows are capped together, since a run that is never resolved grows all three; past
the cap `ys_read_token` returns `YS_FAILED_MEMORY`, the caller's sizing to fix.

## §1 — The central principle: six parameters, two fates

The productions are indexed by six parameters, and the generator's core intellectual move — a binding-time analysis — is
to sort them into two fates and treat those completely differently. `c` and `n` are the exemplars.

- **`c` — context · STATIC.** `c` ranges over a **finite** set (block-in, block-out, flow-in, flow-out, block-key,
  flow-key). Specialize it away at generation time: each `c`-parameterized production monomorphizes into ≤6 concrete
  ones. Compile-time. Gone from the runtime.
- **`n` — indentation · RUNTIME.** `n` is an **unbounded** integer threaded as `s-indent(n)`, `s-indent(<n)`,
  `s-indent(≤n)`. It cannot be specialized away; it must survive into the emitted automaton, carried on the indentation
  stack.

The others follow the same two fates: **`t`** (chomping — strip, clip, keep) and **`r`** (the resume policy — what
`ys_options.resume` chooses) are finite, so they are specialized away like `c`; **`m`** (the auto-detected indent) and
**`f`** (the floor a block scalar's leading empty lines set for its first content line) are unbounded integers, so they
are threaded like `n`. So the runtime carries `n`, `m` and `f`, and never sees `c`, `t` or `r` — the emitted C is one
automaton per resume policy, and `ys_options.resume` picks the start state.

Getting this split right is the crux: partial-evaluate over `c` while *preserving* `n`.

```
# a production, before and after c-specialization
ns-plain(n, c)          ::= parameterized on both

  # becomes, at generation time:
ns-plain-blockKey(n)    # c pinned → concrete automaton fragment
ns-plain-flowIn(n)      # n still threaded → indentation stack
```

## §2 — Target architecture: what the generated parser looks like

The pull-API requirement (caller invokes `next_token()`; the parser does *not* call the caller back) forces the lowering
target and, helpfully, agrees with the speed and streaming requirements. All three want the same non-recursive machine.

**One automaton, not two layers.** A scanner emitting tokens for a parser to consume would need a vocabulary between
them, and yeast has none: the automaton's output already *is* the token stream — the `Begin`/`End` markers and the
classified spans of input. A hand-written scanner would also be the one thing on the hot path the grammar did not
derive. So there is a single character-driven automaton, `c`-specialized and `n`-threaded, emitting yeast tokens into an
output queue; `next_token()` hands back the queue's first token once it is decided.

**An explicit pushdown automaton, not a call stack.** A recursive-descent shape keeps "where am I" in the C
return-address chain, which cannot suspend to return a token. So the generator emits a **state enum + explicit heap
stack + single dispatch loop**. Suspension is then free: run the loop until a token is produced, save the state struct,
return. This is exactly libyaml's shape — and libyaml's API is already pull for the same reason.

**The deferred set is a token queue with a resolution tag.** The "possibly-key, possibly-scalar" hypothesis becomes a
literal queue entry marked *provisional*. `next_token()` returns the frontmost *resolved* token, advancing input only
when the head is still ambiguous or the queue is empty. Because the ambiguity is line-bounded, the eager buffering
before an honest return is bounded too.

**The canonical stream is yeast.** The event/node stream the parser emits is **yeast** — YamlReference's own token
model: zero-width `Begin`/`End` markers wrapping the interesting productions, and every consumed character classified as
a leaf token (`Indicator`, `White`, `Indent`, `Break`, `Text`, `Meta`, …). The codes are kept **byte-identical to
YamlReference's `Code` constructors** (already declared as `ys_code` in the public header), and that one decision makes
the single stream do three jobs at once:

- **The load API** — `compose → resolve → serialize` is a downstream fold over yeast. YAMLStar already owns that back
  half and already eats these tokens, so the JSON path is a front-end swap, not new code (phase 06).
- **A debug view** — folding the balanced `Begin`/`End` markers rebuilds the nested productions tree, rendered by the
  package's own `yaml2html` (migrated from YamlReference; phase 05). Identical codes make the port a faithful copy,
  validated against YamlReference's own rendering.
- **The differential oracles** — identical codes make the yeast comparison against YamlReference token-for-token; the
  folded load output is checked value-for-value against YAMLStar (§3).

**Where the rewind problem went:** a backtracking parser would have to discard emitted events on every failed
alternative. The determinized automaton (phase 03) doesn't backtrack — committed transitions emit on commit, so there is
nothing to rewind. The only provisional events are those inside the line-bounded simple-key lookahead; they live in the
deferred queue above and are discarded there if the key hypothesis fails. The single-line rule that bounds that deferral
bounds its event retention too. Indentation detection, the other deferral, retains nothing at all: it consumes and emits
as it goes (§0).

**The grammar is libyeast's own.** `grammar/yeast-spec-1.2.yaml` holds the productions *and* the yeast codes they emit;
the vendored `yaml-spec-1.2.yaml` holds neither the token layer nor the structure it needs, having inlined the indicator
characters. A gate erases libyeast's additions and recovers the official grammar exactly, so the generator's input is
hand-authored where it must be and machine-proved where it can be.

```c
/* the emitted C surface — pull, suspendable, arena-backed (see include/yeast.h for the full declared API) */
ys_parser *ys_new_string_parser(const char *input, size_t length, const ys_options *options);
ys_token ys_next_token(ys_parser *parser); /* one token, or ERROR, then halts */
void ys_free_parser(ys_parser *parser);
```

## §3 — Validation strategy: how fidelity is actually earned

Passing tests is a floor, not a proof — every place backtracking is replaced by a committed decision is a place the
automaton can diverge from the productions' meaning. So validation runs on three fidelity legs, strongest first — plus a
fourth, orthogonal leg for safety:

- **Refinement obligation (where feasible).** The determinization transform must be shown to preserve the language of
  the productions — commit-here *and here's why it's still the same language*. This is the part that touches
  formal-methods territory and is what makes the result worth more than libyaml.
- **Differential oracles — both reference implementations.** The parser is pinned against *both* references, each
  authoritative for a different half of the pipeline. Against **YamlReference** the comparison is *token-for-token* on
  yeast — codes are identical, so it validates the syntactic layer (production structure, character classes) at the
  finest possible grain. Against **YAMLStar** the comparison is *value-for-value* on the folded load output, validating
  composition and schema resolution — the semantic layer. Agreement with both spans the whole pipeline; a mismatch with
  exactly one half localizes the bug, and the yeast→HTML debug view renders the divergence.
- **YAML Test Suite + fuzzing.** The ~350+ case suite as the empirical floor; structure-aware fuzzing over the grammar
  to hunt the long tail, especially in the semantic rules the BNF doesn't capture.
- **Memory-safety & adversarial auditing.** This library is a building block for sensitive software parsing untrusted,
  possibly hostile input, so safety is a first-class validation axis — not an afterthought. ASan/UBSan run on every
  oracle pass; structure-aware fuzzing runs continuously from day one. A written **threat model** covers the
  YAML-specific denial-of-service classes: billion-laughs / recursive alias expansion, pathological nesting depth,
  unbounded allocation, quadratic blow-up. The pushdown design already removes C-stack overflow; the explicit heap stack
  carries a *configurable depth cap* and every allocation is bounded. Security is audited across the whole build,
  continuously.

## §4 — Implementation phases

Phases are ordered by dependency. **Phase 02 is a gate**: the grammar and its fixtures are made spec-complete and
enforcing before the transformation touches them, so Phase 03 never has to go back to the grammar. The deepest research
risk then lives in **phase 03** (the normalization pipeline, where determinization happens); the semantic decisions that
feed it are settled in phase 02. The rest — codegen and the ABI layer — is well-trodden compiler work.

### Phase 01 — The reference interpreter · the grammar's executor, and the project's oracle

The interpreter is complete: it executes the grammar over the input a byte at a time — a byte that begins no character a
value of its own, `<invalid>`, rather than an exception thrown before the parse starts — so a token's text is the input
bytes as they are, and ill-formed input is proved against fixtures, in the grammar, before the C parser is generated
from it. Everything downstream then has one oracle instead of two.

Still to be scoped, when something needs it: the interpreter's committed mode is phase 03's, where the grammar it judges
is the one that has been transformed.

### Phase 02 — Completeness · the grammar and fixtures made spec-complete, and the gate before transformation

Phase 02 is complete: the grammar is as spec-complete as it can be made, and its gate holds. The BNF is recovered
production-for-production from libyeast's own grammar (`check_vendor_spec`), and every constraint the spec leaves to
prose — the single-line simple-key restriction and its length bound, tab forbidden as indentation, `#` opening a comment
only after whitespace, line-break normalization, and the block-scalar §8.1.1.1 rules — is a rule in the grammar with a
fixture that fails when the behaviour is wrong, or a declared deviation with its reason. The independent net is the YAML
Test Suite, folded to events (`make verify-star`): every case folds to its events or rejects where it must, one declared
divergence apart — where the YAML Test Suite follows YAMLStar past the spec, and libyeast follows the spec. With
`check_vendor_spec` green, the prose inventory closed, and the fold green-or-declared, the grammar is frozen for Phase
03 to carry through its provable steps.

Still to be scoped, when something needs it: the yeast→HTML debug view — the divergence microscope, bootstrapped on
YamlReference's `yaml2html`, later the oracle for the package's own port (Phase 05) — and the differential fuzz corpus
CI runs beside the fold.

### Phase 03 — Normalize · the grammar-to-canonical pipeline

*Risk: High — the prize · ~3–6 mo.* This is where the backtracking grammar becomes a committed one, and it is done not
as one leap but as a **series of small, individually-provable, semantics-preserving transformations** that carry the raw
IR to a canonical form a state machine falls out of. It runs over the grammar frozen at Phase 02's gate: every step
preserves the interpreter's token stream, so a grammar bug is Phase 02's to have caught, never this pipeline's to
introduce. Binding-time, `c`/`t` specialization, determinization, and the lowering to a pushdown shape — the old
separate mechanical phases — are all steps of this one pipeline. Performance of the generator is a non-issue; every step
is written to be simple enough to prove by eye, and checked two ways after it runs.

**The canonical form.** A **terminal production** is a set of characters, nothing more. A **nonterminal production** is
an ordered list of alternatives. An alternative is `gate  actions…  [P1  actions…]  [P2]`:

- The **gate** is a conjunction, tested without consuming: an optional character-set peek and zero or more zero-width
  guards. The alternative fires only if every part holds. An **empty** gate is the unconditional fallthrough, allowed
  only as the last alternative.
- **actions** operate on the parser's own state (below). Consuming the peeked character is itself an action, not part of
  the gate.
- **P1, P2** are zero, one, or two production invocations. Two means *run P1 then P2*: push a frame whose return is P2,
  go to P1, and when P1 returns resume at P2 — so P1 is the call, P2 the continuation, and at most one push per edge.
  One is a tail-goto; none returns. There are no actions after P2: a production returns exactly when its P2 does. A
  sequence of three splits through a helper, `A → B A₁`, `A₁ → C D`, and the `_<N>` suffix names where it came from.

Alternatives are tested in order and the first whose gate fires is **committed** — no backtracking. Two alternatives may
share a gate; order resolves the overlap, and proving that the earlier one is safe to commit to is the whole of
determinization.

**The action vocabulary**, four families, each derived from an IR node or the runtime already built in `src/parser.h`:

- **Token run** — `Consume` (push the peeked character into the current run), `PushCode(code)`/`PopCode` (cut the run
  and set the code its characters carry, or restore the production's own — the run code it carries on its frame,
  restored past a nested token, not a stack), `Emit(code)` (a zero-width marker, which also cuts),
  `OpenMatch`/`CloseMatch` (mark and restore the `(match)` origin the production likewise carries on its frame), and
  `OpenWindow(limit, message)`/`CloseWindow` (open and restore the `(max)` character window it likewise carries, past
  which a committed `Consume` fails the window's cut). These are what `Token`/`Wrap`/`Emit`/`(<<<)`/`(max)` lower to.
- **Provisional run** — `OpenProvisional`, `RetypeProvisional(payload, break)` (the block scalar's held run carries both
  content and the breaks between it, so retyping names two codes), `InjectBefore(code)`, `CommitProvisional`.
  One-for-one with the `ys_queue` run. There is no discard: a failed hypothesis retypes, it never drops tokens.
- **Parameters** — `SetIndentToColumn`, `IncreaseIndentToColumn` (`f = max(f, column)`, what `(increase)` lowers to for
  the block-scalar floor), `AdjustIndent(expr)`, `SetIndentFromDigit`. Only `n`, `m` and `f` are runtime; `c` and `t`
  are specialized away and never appear. Counting indentation is a loop of `[space]` gates with an accumulator action,
  not a special multi-character gate.
- **Guards** — `AtStartOfLine`, `AtEndOfStream`, `IndentLt/Le/Eq(n)`, `WithinKeyLimit`. A guard is a cheap zero-width
  condition on an alternative; the sharp case that forces the gate to be a conjunction is indentation matching, where
  both the eat-another-space and the stop alternatives gate on `[space]` and are told apart only by `column < n`.

The load-bearing rule: **no lookahead survives.** `Look`/`NegLook`/`LookBehind`/`ExcludeAt` over more than one character
are transformed away — into a char-set gate, a cheap guard, or provisional speculation — so a canonical grammar holds
none of them, and the validator rejects any that remain.

**The pipeline**, one linear series, grouped only for reading:

1. *Parameters.* Specialize `c` away (monomorphize, drop `Case`/`Flip` on `c`, prune unreachable branches); specialize
   `t` (chomping) the same way. Confirm only `n`/`m` remain, and only in indentation predicates and parameter actions.
1. *Structural.* Flatten `Seq`/`Alt`, drop `Empty`, collapse singletons. Lower `Token`/`Wrap` to token actions, `(<<<)`
   to the `(match)`-origin pair, and `(max)` to the window pair. Evaluate `Diff` and single-character `Look`/`NegLook`
   into plain char-sets. Lower `Star`/`Plus`/`Opt`/`Rep` into recursive `_<N>` productions. Lower
   `SetVar`/`Bind`/`Lt`/`Le`/`StartOfLine`/`EndOfStream` into parameter actions and guards.
1. *Alternative shape.* Split each `Seq` into head-matcher + tail until every alternative is `matcher; actions; tail`.
   Binarize to ≤2 calls. Hoist FIRST-sets into gates, handling a nullable call as FIRST∪FOLLOW. Turn a leading
   unconditional action into an empty-gate alternative.
1. *Determinize* — the hard tier, still small steps. Fold residual one-token lookahead into gates. Left-factor shared
   prefixes into a common gate and a branch, repeated until each decision is one-character-decidable. Insert provisional
   speculation for the two unbounded cases — the simple-key line and the block-scalar opening empty lines. Handle the
   two indentation gotchas the mechanical steps miss — a zero-indent block sequence nested directly in a mapping, and
   flow context, which suspends indentation entirely. Discharge commit-safety per decision point, logging any residual
   as an assurance gap.
1. *Finish.* Dead-production elimination; assert every terminal is a pure char-set; run the validator.

**The validator** is the target invariant and equals "done": every production is a terminal char-set or an ordered list
of canonical alternatives; no `Star`/`Plus`/`Opt`/`Rep`/`Look`/`NegLook`/`Diff`/`Token`/`Wrap`/`Case` survives; every
alternative is gate-led with ≤2 calls and no post-P2 action; and every decision point is commit-safe.

**The verification net** is the **reference interpreter from Phase 01**, now taught the canonical/action nodes this
pipeline introduces and given a second mode. It is a slow, backtracking executor with undo — performance being a
non-issue — and it runs in two modes off one flag:

- **Backtracking mode** is the baseline. Diff its token stream before and after *every* step against the yaml-test
  suite; a step that changes any output is rejected. This is the net for all sixteen steps, and the interpreter doubles
  as an early differential oracle against YamlReference.
- **Committed mode** respects the gates and never backtracks. After the determinize steps, both modes must agree on the
  corpus; a divergence means a gate is not commit-safe — the one thing the structural invariants and the backtracking
  interpreter cannot catch on their own.

**Exit** — a canonical grammar the validator passes, on which the interpreter agrees in both modes across the corpus, so
that emitting the C state machine (Phase 05) is mechanical rather than clever.

### Phase 04 — Deferral · The two provisional cases, worked out concretely

*Risk: Medium · ~2–3 mo.* Phase 03's determinize step says "insert provisional speculation for the two unbounded cases"
in one line; this is that line worked out. The queue and its undecided run are already built (`src/parser.h`), so what
is left is the exact sequence of `OpenProvisional`/`RetypeProvisional`/`InjectBefore`/`CommitProvisional` actions for
each case, and the proof — via the interpreter's committed mode — that each resolves the run correctly.

1. Implement bounded eager buffering for the simple-key line; resolve key-vs-scalar on line completion or `:`.
1. Implement the block scalar's opening empty lines: hold the run, and on resolution either make it content or inject
   `end-scalar` ahead of it and make it breaks.
1. Verify end-to-end token output against the oracle, with the deferral exercised deliberately.

**Exit** — the two deferrals resolve correctly, pull-driven, oracle-clean.

### Phase 05 — C codegen · Emit the C library

*Risk: Low · ~1–2 mo.* The easy end of every compiler. Turn the lowered IR into a switch-on-state character loop with
arena allocation.

1. Emit the state dispatcher and the transition tables into `src/parser_tables.h`, as portable C99 with no external
   deps, over the runtime `src/parser.c` already provides.
1. Emit, per state, the production it belongs to and what its outgoing edges expect — a table of static strings shaped
   like `src/messages.c`'s, and the text of every format error. What the parser found is not in them, and need not be:
   the first `unparsed` token behind an error begins at exactly the byte that failed.
1. Arena-allocate everything; lifetimes are input-bounded, so free the arena on parser teardown — no GC.
1. Handle backtracking-region scratch within the arena; ensure discarded provisional state is reclaimed cleanly.
1. Emit the pull surface: `new` / `next_token` / `free`, plus structured error extraction.
1. Emit the `Code` enum and the compose fold (yeast → node graph); event retention is trace-mode only — the committed
   hot path emits and consumes without buffering.
1. Migrate `yaml2html` into the package: a small C companion that folds the yeast stream to colorized nested HTML,
   sharing the emitted `Code` enum — so the debug view ships *with* the library and carries no YamlReference dependency.
   Validate byte-for-byte against the YamlReference renderer.
1. Build as `cdylib`-style `.so` across Linux/macOS (and Windows once the toolchain is clean).

**Exit** — a self-contained C `.so`, plus the bundled `yaml2html` tool, passing suite + differential + fuzz.

### Phase 06 — ABI layer · Drop-in for libyamlstar

*Risk: Low · ~3–5 wks.* The existing YAMLStar ABI was designed as a swappable seam — thin, JSON-string in/out, no
exposed structs — so this is nearly free. Every existing binding works unchanged.

1. Reimplement the create/destroy/`load`/`load_all`/`version` entry points over the new core.
1. Route `load` through the yeast fold — `compose → resolve → serialize` — reusing YAMLStar's existing resolver and
   dumper rather than reimplementing them; ship the two other consumers of the same stream — the now-bundled `yaml2html`
   debug view and the differential harness.
1. Keep GraalVM-era lifecycle calls as cheap no-ops or lightweight context handles (vestigial, harmless).
1. Serialize errors into the exact type/cause/message shape the bindings parse back out.
1. Reproduce the JSON-interchange contract faithfully (including its documented `.inf`/`.nan` limitation) for true
   drop-in behaviour.
1. Run the existing binding test suites (Python, Go, Rust, C#, …) unmodified against the new `.so`.

**Exit** — the new `.so` slots in where the GraalVM blob sat; all bindings green.

### Phase 07 — Harden · Fuzz, tune, and reach libyaml-class speed

*Risk: Medium · ~2–4 mo.* Correct-but-slow is not the goal. Close the algorithmic gaps naive codegen leaves and prove
robustness under hostile input.

1. Continuous structure-aware + byte-level fuzzing (ASan/UBSan) targeting the semantic long tail.
1. Profile; eliminate any residual super-linear behaviour from over-broad lookahead.
1. Benchmark against libyaml on representative corpora; tune hot states and buffering.
1. Build the release library with link-time optimization, so the one-token-at-a-time dispatch inlines across the
   translation units it is split over.
1. Optionally: extend to an emitter (dump), or keep libyaml's emitter alongside for a complete round-trip library.
1. Cut prebuilt binaries per platform so adoption isn't gated on a local native build.

**Exit** — O(n) confirmed, libyaml-competitive, fuzz-clean, packaged.

## §6 — Future work

Wanted, but not planned, and not on the way to anything else:

- **Lenient wire positions** — treat a `#` line in the wire as a comment, not a required field. Where it carries a token
  position (`# B: …, C: …, L: …, c: …`), use it; where it does not, estimate the position from the tokens themselves
  where that is possible, and otherwise give the token an obvious "no position" value rather than rejecting the wire.
  This lets a wire be hand-written or trimmed, position lines and all, and still read.

- **Token-emission levels** — a knob in `ys_options` choosing how much of the stream `ys_next_token` emits, coarsest to
  finest, each a superset of the last:

  - the structure markers alone — the `begin-`/`end-` pairs that bracket the productions;
  - the payload too — the content characters, which is what the default emits;
  - the non-payload characters as well — indentation, separation, breaks, indicators — so every input byte is covered;
  - the detection values too — `YS_CODE_DETECTED` tokens carrying the `m`/`t` an indentation or chomping rule computed,
    which is what makes libyeast's detection comparable to YamlReference's `Detected` output token for token.

  This is why `YS_CODE_DETECTED` is in the vocabulary already: the finest level is where libyeast emits it, and the wire
  round-trips it in the meantime. A coarser level is cheaper and is all a caller loading a document needs; a finer one
  is what the differential oracle and a debugger want.

- **An event-projecting token source** — a `ys_token_source` that wraps another and is one itself, handing back only the
  event-level tokens: the stream, document, mapping, sequence, scalar and alias markers, a scalar's value already folded
  (a `line-fold` a space, a `line-feed` a newline, an escape resolved) with its anchor and tag attached, everything else
  — the node and pair brackets, indicators, indentation, whitespace, breaks — dropped. It is the C twin of the Python
  fold the YAML Test Suite is checked through: the event stream is a subset of yeast, so the projection is a filter over
  the markers plus the mechanical value fold the codes already settle. A caller wanting YAML events rather than tokens
  reads them straight, without composing a node graph — and because it wraps a source and is a source, it drops in
  wherever tokens already flow.

- **Arena allocators** — revisit the `ys_allocator` API against arena and pool allocators, which free everything at once
  rather than buffer by buffer: whether a no-op `deallocate` is enough as it stands or the shape wants a variant, and
  whether a source's allocations can be arranged so a caller drops the whole parse in a single free. The `close` hook is
  already the seam such an allocator would be torn down through.

- **libc version portability** — deal with the libc-version issues a shared library faces: which symbol versions the
  built `.so` pulls in and their minimums, so a binary built against a newer toolchain still loads on an older target.
  The ABI-compat goal — a libyamlstar drop-in — depends on this not being quietly broken by a libc symbol-version bump.

- Binaries as well as library - yaml2yeast (resume policy in ARGV), yeast2yaml (filtering policy in ARGV), yeast2html
  (based on YamlReference), yaml2event, yeast2event...

## §7 — Shape of the whole

For one very strong engineer who deeply knows both YAML and parser generation, this is a **many-months to
low-single-digit-years** project. The difficulty is lumpy, not uniform:

- **The easy ~70%** — the structural steps of the normalization pipeline, C codegen, the ABI layer. Well-trodden
  compiler work; high effort, low research risk.
- **The hard ~20%** — the determinize steps of the pipeline (phase 03): reducing each decision to a commit-safe one-char
  gate, faithful-by-construction. This is the part that determines whether the result is worth more than libyaml, and it
  touches formal methods.
- **The judgment-heavy long tail** — the semantic layer beyond the BNF, settled into the grammar and its gates (phase
  02), the source of the subtle bugs no single test happens to catch.

The reason this doesn't already exist isn't that any one piece is impossible. It's that the *valuable* version requires
the determinization to be faithful-by-construction — a real proof effort on top of a real compiler — and the set of
people who can do both *and* care enough about YAML specifically is tiny. The generator, not the parsers, is the
mountain. This plan is a route up it.
