All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The ABI is unstable through `0.x`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project framework: CMake build (shared + static, hardened, symbol-visibility controlled), an incremental pre-commit
  `make` gate, tests (acutest), coverage with a `// UNTESTED` contract, Doxygen docs with a completeness gate, and a
  package-consumption test.
- Continuous integration: per-sub-gate GitHub Actions workflows (static quality, C tests, docs) with independent status
  badges and CodeQL analysis, and published API docs plus an HTML coverage report on GitHub Pages.
- Version API: `ys_version`, `ys_major`, `ys_minor`, `ys_patch`.
- Pull-parser API surface: `ys_new_string_parser` / `ys_new_stream_parser` / `ys_next_token` / `ys_free_parser`, with
  `ys_fd_reader`/`ys_fp_reader` reader adapters, a pluggable allocator, and the `ys_counting_allocator` leak counter.
  The parser core is not implemented yet, so `ys_next_token` returns a "not implemented" error.
- Character decoder: UTF-8 input is validated and classified against the grammar without a Unicode codepoint ever being
  assembled. Each character becomes a 32-bit key — the id of the character where the grammar names it, one bit per
  character set the grammar tests, and the bytes it consumed — so a test in the parser is a single comparison or a
  single AND. The tables are generated from the grammar and gated against drift.

_No release has been tagged yet; the YAML parser itself is not implemented._
